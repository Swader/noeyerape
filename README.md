Hosts file for blocking worst ad offenders, and list of adblock filters to apply to block only the most ad-ridden sites.

If you would like to add your own contributions, please submit a pull request. Submit PR violations preferably in the form of a permanent post online with a screenshot.

The contents of the hosts file can also be pasted into Google's Personal Blocklist extension which makes sure those sites never show up on search results again either: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/personal-blocklist-by-goo/nolijncfnkgaikbjbdaogikpmpbdcdef
