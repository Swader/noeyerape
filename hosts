# The following domains have been blocked for breaking the 
# cardinal rule of advertising - no overlay popups. All others 
# will be in the other "adblockrule.txt" file and only have 
# their ads blocked as opposed to these which are completely 
# blocked from ever opening again on my machine.

# Note that the domain lines below can also be pasted into Google's
# Personal Blocklist extension which makes sure they don't appear in
# search results either: http://goo.gl/MmMAl. For more information,
# see the blocklist file in this repository.

# You should already have the following line in your hosts file:
# 127.0.0.1 	localhost

# If not, add it. The hosts file is in the following locations:
