# NoEyeRape - making the web more pleasant to look at, but still not broke.

This repo containst the hosts file for blocking worst ad offenders, and a list of adblock filters to apply to block only the most ad-ridden sites.

If you would like to add your own contributions, please submit a pull request. Submit PR violations preferably in the form of a permanent post online with a screenshot. For examples, see the related filed.

The contents of the hosts file can also be pasted into Google's Personal Blocklist extension which makes sure those sites never show up on search results again either: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/personal-blocklist-by-goo/nolijncfnkgaikbjbdaogikpmpbdcdef
